The Baltic Health Index formally started in 2015 and will run until late 2016. A trans-disciplinary project, it involves researchers from around the Baltic Sea who consult on the  development of a region-specific Index based on a comprehensive assessment of existing data.

The project is led by Thorsten Blenckner (SRC) and a project core team (see the top right box). Researchers appointed as Goalkeepers are together with the core team responsible for one goal each, and work with teams of researchers who are experts on subjects central to each goal. The Steering group includes Johan Rockstr√∂m (SRC), Tina Elfwing (Baltic Sea Centre), Thorsten Blenckner, and Ben Halpern (OHI, NCEAS) and it is responsible for the over-arching project development and external representation.

Engagement with Regional Experts
A project kick-off workshop with invited researchers was held in Stockholm in April 2015. The initial phase, which entailed gathering of data and initial calculation of the Index, ran through 2015 and early 2016.

A policy-oriented workshop was organized together with the Ocean Health Index researchers from California in Stockholm in March, 2016. The two-day workshop gathered expert stakeholders, NGOs, and other scientists from the Baltic Sea region. The aims of the workshop were to present and verify preliminary goals calculations, identify data overlaps and gaps, and assess the connections to policy in a mixed group of experts both familiar with the Index, and new to it.

The team now focuses on continuing the calculations until the launch, planned for late 2016.
