The following data layers are used in Ocean Health Index calculations for goal status, trend, pressures, and resilience. Values for `r study_area` were extracted from the global assessment and saved for each region to serve as a template as you gather higher-resolution data and indicators. Note that many values do not have a range because they were equally extracted from the global data layer.

```{r layers, results='asis'}
layers      = read_csv(sprintf('%s/layers.csv', dir_scenario))      # View(layers)
layers_meta = read_csv(sprintf('%s/layers_meta.csv', dir_scenario)) # View(layers_meta)

for (lyr in sort(layers$layer)){ # lyr = sort(layers$layer)[1]
  # get layer data
  l = layers %>% 
    filter(layer == lyr)
  
  # header, name
  cat(sprintf('## %s\n\n%s\n\n%s\n\n', lyr, l$name, l$description))
  
}
```
