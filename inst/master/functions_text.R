## Each OHI goal model is a separate R function. The function name is the 2- or 3- letter code for each goal or subgoal; for example, FIS is the Fishing subgoal of Food Provision (FP).

## These models originate from Global OHI assessments (ohi-global), and should be tailored to represent the charastics, priorities, and data in your assessment area.
