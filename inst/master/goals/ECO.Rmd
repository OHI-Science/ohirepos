### Goal Description

The Economies goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors. It is composed of a single component, revenue. <!--- Due to a lack data from specific sectors, **for the BHI, this goal is measured by per capita GDP of each region, relative to the national per capita GDP.** --->

### Model & Data

Data for each country were downloaded from the [EU-Study on Blue Growth](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550), Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region‚Äù identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States (MS) of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) and at sea basin level.

<!---
Model compares per capita GDP of each region to the national per capita GDP. Both [BHI regional GDP](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database?p_auth=EgN81qAf&p_p_id=estatsearchportlet_WAR_estatsearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_estatsearchportlet_WAR_estatsearchportlet_action=search&text=nama_10r_3gdp) data and [natinoal GDP](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database?p_auth=sHLAepWT&p_p_id=estatsearchportlet_WAR_estatsearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_estatsearchportlet_WAR_estatsearchportlet_action=search&text=nama_10_gdp) data (in _millions of Euros_) were downloaded from Eurostat database.

### Reference points

*to be determined*
<!---
The reference point is 110% of the highest regional/national GDP per capita within the last 5 years. 
--->

### Considerations for *BHI 2.0*

<!---
In this assessment, GDP used is for entire NUTS3, but divided among populations along a 25km buffer along the shore. 

Population data was not extracted for the entire NUTS3 area, only for the buffer area.  Therefore, the entire GDP for the NUTS3 is allocated among BHI regions, rather than only the GDP associated with the population in the buffer.
