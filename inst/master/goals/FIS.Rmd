### Goal Description

The Fisheries sub-goal of Food Provision describes the ability to maximize the sustainable yield of wild-caught seafood for human consumption. **For the BHI cod and herring stocks in the Baltic Sea were included as wild-caught fisheries**. 


### Model & Data

The data used for this goal are composed of cod and herring spawning biomass (SSB) and fishing mortality (F) data. The current status is calculated as a function of the ratio (B’) between the single species current biomass at sea (B) and the reference biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY), as well as the ratio (F’) between the single species current fishing mortality (F) and the fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (FMSY). B/Bmsy and F/Fmsy data are converted to scores between 0 and 1 using this [general relationship](https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi/blob/draft/baltic2015/prep/FIS/ffms%3By_bbmsy_2_score.png).

### Reference points

The reference point used for the computation are based on the MSY principle and are described as a functional relationship. MSY means the highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken on average from a stock under existing average environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process *(European Union 2013, World Ocean Review 2013).*
